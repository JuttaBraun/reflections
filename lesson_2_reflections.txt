What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- A new git repsitory will be initililized. The .git directory will be created.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- The staging area is between the working area and the repository. I can collect files in staging area, 
  which I what to commit in one commit. Than I can do one commit with one or more files, which belongs to a logical change.
